# smz3tracker

A simple tracker for Super Metroid / Link To The Past Combo Randomizer

Tested in Firefox and Safari. I'm guessing it should work in modern IE browsers, but it's Microsoft so...

Changes in v1.1
- Reduced space between images
- Modified image order for mostly 5 columns
- Moved SM bosses up to be with Z3 bosses when both visible
