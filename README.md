# smz3tracker

A simple tracker for Super Metroid / Link To The Past Combo Randomizer

Tested in Firefox and Safari. I'm guessing it should work in modern IE browsers, but it's Microsoft so...

_Note:_ since this is in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, feel free to download and modify to your own liking!

Changes in v1.1
- Reduced space between images
- Modified image order for mostly 5 columns
- Moved SM bosses up to be with Z3 bosses when both visible
